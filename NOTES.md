# Project Implementation Notes

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Used `<article>` for the main card
   - `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for avatar
   - `<nav>` for social links
   - `<section>` for content groups

2. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Focus indicators visible
   - Semantic heading structure
   - Alt text for images

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
   - Breakpoints at 768px and 1024px

4. **Performance**
   - No external dependencies
   - CSS and JS in single file
   - Optimized animations
